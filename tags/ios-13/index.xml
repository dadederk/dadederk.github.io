I know, iOS 13 has been with us for quite some time now, WWDC 2020 is just around the corner and we hope Apple will present again a ton of new accessibility features and improvements coming with iOS 14.
But it is almost Global Accessibility Awareness Day! And it is still a great time to catch up and implement everything new that was presented around accessibility in iOS 13 - it was a packed year!</description>
