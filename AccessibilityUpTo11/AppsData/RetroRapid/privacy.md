## Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how RetroRapid handles your information.

## Information We Collect

RetroRapid is designed with privacy in mind:

### Information We DO Collect:
- **Game Center Data**: When you use Game Center features (leaderboards, achievements), Apple collects and manages this data according to their privacy policy
- **Game Progress**: Your game settings and progress are stored locally on your device

### Information We DON'T Collect:
- We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- We do not use analytics or tracking services
- We do not collect email addresses, names, or contact information
- We do not use advertising or third-party tracking

## Data Storage

All game data is stored locally on your device. When using Game Center features, that data is managed by Apple's Game Center service and subject to Apple's Privacy Policy.

## Third-Party Services

RetroRapid uses Apple's Game Center for leaderboards and achievements. Use of Game Center is subject to Apple's privacy policy and terms of service.

## Children's Privacy

RetroRapid does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app is designed to be family-friendly and complies with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

## Data Security

Since we don't collect personal data, there's no personal data to secure. Your game progress is stored locally on your device, protected by your device's security features.

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:
- Delete the app to remove all local game data
