# Terms & Conditions for Xarra

_Last updated: 21 February 2026_

Welcome to Xarra! By using the app, you agree to the following terms.

## 1. Use of the App
Xarra is provided for personal and non-commercial use only. You are responsible for how you use the app and the content you import into it. Xarra must not be used to infringe the intellectual property rights of others or for any unlawful purpose.

## 2. Content You Import
You are solely responsible for the content you import into Xarra. By importing content, you confirm that you have the right to access and use it for personal listening purposes. Xarra is strictly a personal listening tool — it is not intended for redistribution, reproduction, or any commercial use of third-party content. Please respect the copyright and licensing terms of any material you import.

## 3. iCloud Sync
Xarra uses Apple's iCloud service to synchronise your Audio Documents and listening progress across your devices. Your iCloud data is governed by [Apple's iCloud Terms and Conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/). We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## 4. Apple Intelligence
On supported devices, Xarra uses Apple Intelligence features (such as summarisation, tagging, and audio-friendly content transformation) to enhance your experience. These features are governed by Apple's own terms and privacy policies. We do not collect or access any data processed by Apple Intelligence on your behalf.

## 5. Subscriptions

Xarra offers optional auto-renewing subscriptions (Monthly and Yearly) that unlock premium features.

- Subscriptions auto-renew until cancelled.
- To cancel, go to **Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions** on your device, or manage subscriptions via the App Store.
- Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period; you retain access to premium features until then.
- The four oldest Audio Documents are always free. A subscription unlocks unlimited Audio Documents.
- 10% of subscription proceeds are donated to AMMEC, an accessibility charity.
- Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase and at renewal. Pricing may vary by region and is shown in the App Store at the time of purchase.
- Subscriptions support **Family Sharing**, so all members of your Family Sharing group can access premium features under a single subscription.

## 6. In-App Purchases and Lifetime Access

- **Lifetime Access** is a one-time, non-consumable purchase that unlocks unlimited Audio Documents within Xarra. It supports **Family Sharing**, so everyone in your Family Sharing group can benefit from the purchase.
- **"Lifetime"** means for the lifetime of the Xarra product — that is, for as long as we make the Xarra app and its premium features available. It does not guarantee that the app or service will exist indefinitely.
- We may discontinue the app or its premium features in the future (for example, if we remove the app from the App Store). If we do, we will use reasonable efforts to give advance notice where practicable. In such a case, Lifetime Access applies for the period the service was available; we are not obliged to provide the service after discontinuation.
- Refunds for subscriptions and in-app purchases are governed by Apple's App Store refund policy. Please contact Apple directly for refund requests.

## 7. Intellectual Property
The Xarra app, its design, and features are the property of Daniel Devesa Derksen-Staats. You retain all rights to the text or documents you create or import into the app.

## 8. Dependencies
Xarra makes use of open-source software (currently [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup)). Such software runs locally on your device and does not affect the terms of your use of Xarra.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties
Xarra is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. While we aim for the best possible experience, we do not guarantee error-free operation.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your use of Xarra, including any content you import or any data stored in iCloud.

## 11. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.

## 12. Changes to the Terms
We may update these Terms in the future. Continued use of Xarra after updates means you accept the new Terms.
