# Privacy Policy for Xarra

_Last updated: 21 February 2026_

Xarra respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your information.

## Data Collection
Xarra does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to its developers or any third parties.

- No accounts are required.
- No analytics or tracking are used.
- No data is shared with third parties by us.

## Storage and iCloud Sync
Your Audio Documents and listening progress are stored on your device and, if you have iCloud enabled, synchronised across your devices via Apple's iCloud service. This means your content is stored in your personal iCloud account and is subject to [Apple's iCloud Terms and Conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/) and [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

You are in full control of this data and can manage or delete it at any time through the app or through your device's iCloud settings.

## Content You Import
Xarra is designed for personal use. The content you import into the app — articles, documents, web pages, or other text — remains in your personal iCloud account and is not accessed by us in any way. You are responsible for ensuring that any content you import is used in accordance with applicable copyright and licensing terms.

## Apple Intelligence
On supported devices, Xarra uses Apple Intelligence to summarise, tag, and categorise your content, and to perform other on-device processing such as transforming code snippets into audio-friendly explanations. Apple Intelligence processing happens on your device or through Apple's Private Cloud Compute, under Apple's own privacy protections. No content is shared with us as a result of these features. For more details, see [Apple's AI and Machine Learning Privacy page](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-intelligence/).

## Purchases and Subscriptions
All in-app purchases and subscription payments are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information. Your purchase history is managed by Apple and is subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

If you have a subscription or Lifetime Access, the App Store may share with us a non-personal receipt token to verify your entitlement. No personally identifiable information is shared with us as part of this process.

## Dependencies
Xarra uses [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup), an open-source HTML parser that runs entirely on your device and does not collect or transmit any data.

## Children's Privacy
Because Xarra does not collect or share any information with us, it is safe for use by all ages.

## Changes to This Policy
We will update this Privacy Policy if Xarra's functionality changes in a way that affects how your data is handled. You will be able to review any changes before updating the app.
