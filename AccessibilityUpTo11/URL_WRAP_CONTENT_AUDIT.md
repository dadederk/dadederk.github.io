AccessibilityUpTo11/Content/post/2020-05-13-01.md:158:Of course, SwiftUI was also presented in the WWDC19. Like everything that Apple does, accessibility is built-in right from the beginning. For sure you’ve noticed already that a lot of things in iOS are accessible by default. But this is even more true with SwiftUI thanks of its declarative nature and because it is state-driven. This probably deserves its own post, or even series of posts, so I totally recommend you [Rob Whitaker](https://medium.com/@r.whitaker)’s great SwiftUI Accessibility Series: https://rwapp.co.uk/2019/11/06/SwiftUI-Accessibility/
